Rock the Reindeer

Your elf is an xmas rocker
Listen to the snowman
Until Your elf is mysterious
If the snowman is silent
Listen to the snowman

If the snowman is silent
Your elf is mysterious

the moon is ice
our gingerbread is celebrated
shout the snowman
Until the snowman is mysterious
burn the snowman
put the snowman plus our gingerbread into our gingerbread
Rock the reindeer with our gingerbread
Listen to the snowman
